Noteworthy changes in version 0.8 (2008-02-01)
----------------------------------------------

    * The file format is now included as part of the base16 output, as

      via the --file-format command.  Suggested by Brendan Kidwell.

      to the SHA-1 code on platforms that require aligned access.
      Thanks to Peter Palfrader.
