%description
A reasonable way to achieve a long term backup of OpenPGP (PGP, GnuPG,
etc) keys is to print them out on paper.  The reasoning behind this is
that paper and ink has amazingly long retention qualities - far longer
than the magnetic or optical means that are generally used to back up
computer data.  A paper backup isn't a replacement for the usual
machine readable (tape, CD-R, DVD-R, etc) backups, but rather as an
if-all-else-fails method of restoring a key.
